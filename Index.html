                    <h1>HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the largest democracies in the world, India will celebrate its 74th Independence Day
                        on
                        15th of August, 2020. This day marks the historic occasion when the country finally broke
                        the
                        shackles of oppression and gained independence from the British empire in the year 1947.
                        The British rule was established in India through East India Company in the year 1757 and
                        the
                        Company exercised control over India for 100 years. The fight for ‘Aazadi’ (freedom) from
                        the
                        British Raj truly began with the Indian Revolt of 1987, which is also known as the Indian
                        Mutiny. The British played the trick of “divide and rule policy” as slowly, India came under
                        direct British rule as the Britishers gradually strengthened their hold over the nation.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Let’s salute the martyrs for the sacrifices they made and thank them for giving us our
                        freedom.
                        Happy Independence Day 2020.

                            Quit India-Movement
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            On August 8, 78 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi gave the call for British colonisers to “Quit
                            India” and for the Indians to “do or die” to make this happen. Soon after, Gandhi and
                            almost
                            the entire top Congress leadership was arrested, and thus began a truly people-led
                            movement
                            in our freedom struggle, eventually quelled violently by the British, but leaving behind
                            a
                            clear message – the British would have to leave India, and no other solution would be
                            acceptable to its masses.

                            What led to the events of August 1942

                            While factors leading to such a movement had been building up, matters came to a head
                            with
                            the failure of the Cripps Mission.

                            The World War II was raging, and a beleaguered British needed the cooperation of their
                            colonial subjects in India. To this end, in March 1942, a mission led by Sir Stafford
                            Cripps
                            arrived in India to meet leaders of the Congress and the Muslim League. The idea was to
                            secure India’s whole-hearted support in the war, in return for self-governance.However,
                            despite the promise of “the earliest possible realisation of self-government in India”,
                            the
                            offer Cripps made was of dominion status, and not freedom. Also, there was a provision
                            of
                            the partition of India, which was not acceptable to the Congress.

                            The failure of the Cripps Mission made Mahatma Gandhi realise that freedom would be had
                            only
                            by fighting tooth and nail for it.
                            Though initially reluctant to launch a movement that could hamper Britain’s efforts to
                            defeat Fascist forces in the World War, the Congress eventually decided to launch a mass
                            civil disobedience. At the Working Committee meeting in Wardha in July 1942, it was
                            decided
                            the time had come for the movement to move into an active phase.

                                    British rule in India began in 1757 when, following the British victory at the
                                    Battle of Plassey, the English East India Company began exercising control over
                                    the
                                    country. The East India Company ruled India for 100 years, until it was replaced
                                    by
                                    direct British rule (often referred to as the British raj) in the wake of the
                                    Indian
                                    Mutiny in 1857–58. The Indian independence movement began during World War I and
                                    was
                                    led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who advocated for a peaceful and nonviolent end to
                                    British rule.

                                    Independence Day is marked throughout India with flag-raising ceremonies,
                                    drills,
                                    and the singing of the Indian national anthem. Additionally, various cultural
                                    programs are made available in the state capitals. After the prime minister
                                    participates in the flag-raising ceremony at the Red Fort historic monument in
                                    Old
                                    Delhi, a parade ensues with members of the armed forces and police. The prime
                                    minister then delivers a televised address to the country, recounting the major
                                    accomplishments of India during the previous year and outlining future
                                    challenges
                                    and goals. Kite flying has also become an Independence Day tradition, with kites
                                    of
                                    various sizes, shapes, and colours filling the sky. Also, to commemorate the
                                    day,
                                    government offices in New Delhi remain lit throughout the holiday, even though
                                    they
                                    are closed.

                                        <p>
                                            The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict, was an armed conflict
                                            between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in
                                            the
                                            Kargil district of Kashmir. The cause of the war was the infiltration of
                                            Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian
                                            side
                                            of the Line of Control, which serves as the de facto border between the
                                            two
                                            nations. Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri
                                            insurgents; however, documents left behind by casualties and later
                                            statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed
                                            involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces. The Indian Army, supported
                                            by
                                            the air force, attacked the Pakistani positions and, with international
                                            diplomatic support, eventually forced a Pakistani withdrawal across the
                                            Line
                                            of Control (LoC).

                                            The war is one of the most recent examples of high altitude warfare in
                                            mountainous terrain, and posed significant logistical problems for the
                                            combating sides. This was the first ground war between the two countries
                                            after they had developed nuclear weapons. (India and Pakistan both

                                            nuclear
                                            test was conducted in 1974.) The conflict led to heightened tensions
                                            between
                                            the two nations and increased defence spending on the part of India. In
